# UI-ForestryMangementApp Design - by Helen Wu

This Forestry Logistics Management App's user interface design reflects a critical emphasis on usability and efficiency tailored for field operations and logistics management. The navigation is streamlined to facilitate swift access to core functionalities. 

The site visitation interface employs a scrollable thumbnail layout to efficiently manage and select sites, coupled with action-specific options such as initiating new visits or arranging shipments, enhancing user interaction with the app. 

Booking site visits merges visual data and vital logistical information, including recent photos, contact details, and a built-in map for quick navigation. 

For shipment management, the interface simplifies complex logistics by offering intuitive selection options for shipment sizes and types, ensuring users can easily arrange the transport of various wood products. 

This integration of design elements underscores commitment to an optimal user experience, prioritising operational fluidity and clear, actionable pathways throughout the app.
